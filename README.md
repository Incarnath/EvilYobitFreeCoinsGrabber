EvilYobitFreeCoinsGrabber
=========================
Tampermonkey script for Yobit's Free Coins page.

Clicks all "Get free coins" buttons automatically on Yobit's "free coins" page
Saves you time so that you don't have to click hundreds of buttons

Instructions:

1. Install the [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) add-on in your Chrome browser.
2. Make sure that the [EvilYobitFreeCoinsGrabber.user.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coins4lunch/EvilYobitFreeCoinsGrabber/master/EvilYobitFreeCoinsGrabber.user.js) script is loaded and enabled in Tampermonkey.
3. Log onto https://yobit.net/
4. Go to page https://yobit.net/en/freecoins/

This script will automatically click on the "Get free coins" buttons for all eligible coins. 
It should take several seconds, depending on the number of buttons and server / Internet speeds.

#### NOTE: This tests successfully on the latest Chrome browser with Tampermonkey
#### This is not working currently on Firefox with Greasemonkey

#### WARNING: Sometime in January 2016 (after I authored this script), Yobit forbid the use of automation on their free coins page. Use this script at your own risk!
